          body: |
              Automated changes by `update-service-components.yaml` workflow.
              Compare and merge to keep common assets up to date with [lecture_service/service](slds-lmu/lecture_service).
              This branch will automatically be updated on subsequent commits.

              Files that are kept track of include:
              - The `style` folder for LaTeX style files and preambles.
              - Makefiles in `slides/`, specifically `tex.mk` and `R.mk`.
              - GitHub actions workflows in `.github`.
              - LICENSE and other common assets that do not need to differ between lectures.
              - .gitattributes and .editorconfig, in an attempt to prevent common minor issues.
